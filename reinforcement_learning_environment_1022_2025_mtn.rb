# reinforcement_learning_environment.rb
# This file represents a simple reinforcement learning environment using Ruby and Hanami framework.

# Define the ReinforcementLearningEnvironment class
class ReinforcementLearningEnvironment
  # Initialize the environment with any necessary parameters
  def initialize
    # Initialize state, rewards, and other environment parameters
  end

  # Define a method to reset the environment to its initial state
  def reset
    # Reset the environment state and return the initial state
  end

  # Define a method to step the environment forward in time
  def step(action)
    # Apply the action to the environment and return the next state, reward, and done flag
    # Handle any errors that may occur during the step
    begin
      # Environment logic to apply the action and calculate next state and reward
      # Return the next state, reward, and whether the episode is done
    rescue StandardError => e
      # Log the error and handle it appropriately
      puts "An error occurred during the step: #{e.message}"
      # Return a default state, reward, and done flag
    end
  end

  # Define a method to render the environment (if applicable)
  def render
    # Render the environment for visualization purposes
  end

  # Define a method to close the environment (if applicable)
  def close
    # Close any resources used by the environment
  end
end

# Below is an example usage of the ReinforcementLearningEnvironment class
if __FILE__ == $0
  # Create an instance of the ReinforcementLearningEnvironment
  environment = ReinforcementLearningEnvironment.new

  # Reset the environment to its initial state
  initial_state = environment.reset
  puts "Initial State: #{initial_state}"

  # Perform a step in the environment with a random action
  action = rand(0..10) # Replace with a proper action generation logic
  next_state, reward, done = environment.step(action)
  puts "Next State: #{next_state}, Reward: #{reward}, Done: #{done}"
