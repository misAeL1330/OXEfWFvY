# performance_test_script.rb
#
# This script is designed to perform performance testing on a Hanami application.
# It includes error handling, comments, and follows Ruby best practices.

require 'hanami'
require 'benchmark'
require 'logger'

# Set up logging
logger = Logger.new($stdout)
logger.level = Logger::INFO

# Ensure the Hanami application is configured properly
Hanami.boot

# Define a helper method to perform a single HTTP request
def perform_request
  # This is a placeholder for the actual request logic
  # It should be replaced with the code that performs the HTTP request
  # For example, using Hanami::Action::Http::Client
  response = Hanami::Action::Http::Client.new.get("/")
  response.status
rescue StandardError => e
  logger.error "Error performing request: #{e.message}"
  500
end

# Define the performance test

  # Number of iterations for the performance test
  iterations = 100

  # Warm up the system by performing a few requests
  warm_up_iterations = 10
  warm_up_iterations.times { perform_request }

  # Benchmark the performance of the application
  benchmark_result = Benchmark.realtime do
    iterations.times { perform_request }
  end

  # Log the average response time per request
  average_response_time = benchmark_result / iterations
  logger.info "Average response time: #{average_response_time} seconds"

# Run the performance test
